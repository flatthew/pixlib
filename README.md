# pixlib
This is a really dumb side project I made using python and pygame. 
In essence, it works by creating a massive array of pixel objects, which cover an entire pygame window, and then everything that is displayed is made on top of this.
It was created mostly as something to do while procrastinating or busy.

## What this is for
- Memes

## What this is most definitely not for
- Anything at all serious, this thing is horrifically inefficient, and probably incredibly wasteful in terms of both memory and CPU usage.
