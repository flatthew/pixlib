# pixlib
This is a really dumb side project I made using python and pygame. Genuinely no idea why I am even uploading this right now.
In essence, it works by creating a massive array of pixel objects, which cover an entire pygame window, and then everything that is displayed is made on top of this.
It was created mostly as something to do while procrastinating or busy.
